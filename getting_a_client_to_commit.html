# Implementation Strategy

"Meeting Structure" (Psychological flow):

3. Guide discovery (problem exploration)
4. Present solution (tailored approach)
5. Secure commitment (clear next steps)

.reference[Source: Academy of Management Journal - "Negotiating relationally: The dynamics of the relational self in negotiations"]

.highlight[Key Learning: Each small 'yes' built momentum toward the final deal]
